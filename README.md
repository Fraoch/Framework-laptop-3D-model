# Framework-laptop-3D-model

My first 3D model is of the Framework laptop and I thought I'd share it here in case it helped anyone. The dimensions should be accurate to +/- 0.5mm, maybe better in smaller areas where I was able to measure with micrometers, say +/- 0.2 mm.

I need to add more detail, of course, but some areas are really complicated - just run your finger along the curve from the front of the laptop over the speaker grille to the expansion cards, for instance. I don't have the skill to do something like that yet.

Perhaps FreeCAD experts will find I've done this completely the wrong way and I'll admit to that but it would be nice if they used their expertise to refine this model.

But this should be good for overall dimensions and more. Refinements and improvements are welcome.
